For this project we received raw radar data (h5) and the desired output is a clustered pointcloud based on the clusters rain and birds. <br />
Here we tried various cluster techniques and described which has the best result for radarclustering.
## Software used:
* CloudCompare (visualization of pointclouds)
* Python 2 + 3 (notebooks are in Python 2)
* Scikit packages (sklearn)
* numpy
* h5py (h5 file handling)
* Various other imports:
    - csv
    - sys
    - math
## Contents
